There are comments in the files explaining parts too.. I started by creating different packages for the different types of classes. At first models contain 4 classes of which Vehicle.java is the root
abstract class and the parent of the others. Contains the needed properties of the other class. In the util package, the Invoice class is creating
and visualize the needed invoice for the client. The constructor is given all the needed information about the invoice. I overrided the method toString
where I did some calculations and formulated the end invoice. In the main package is the main class where i just create some objects of every class and print them.
the results on the console.
